# databases
Repository that comprises all work done during the course of Databases at University of Aveiro. The objectives are understanding the data modeling techniques oriented to documents, key / value, columns and graphs, and select appropriate solutions taking into account the type of information and the functional requirements of the systems to be developed.

Each directory corresponds to a practical guide and each subdirectory, with its own readme file, corresponds to a question topic.
